# ðŸ§Š CrystalSAT  

**CrystalSAT** is a Python library for generating valid crystal structures using **constraint programming** and **SAT solvers**.  

Traditional crystal generators often rely on stochastic sampling or machine learning, which can produce large numbers of invalid candidates that require expensive filtering. CrystalSAT takes a different approach: by encoding chemical and geometric rules directly into a satisfiability framework, it produces **valid-by-construction** structures.  

CrystalSAT is designed for use in **materials science, solid-state physics, and computational chemistry**, providing a flexible and extensible foundation for research into lattice geometries, symmetry, and crystal structure prediction.
